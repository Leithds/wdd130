    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Leith Schmidtlein</h2>
    <p>Hello fellow class members! I'm excited to be here and learn more about web design. I know nothing about this, so I am excited to learn more. 
        Thankfully my wife graduated with a Web Design major so I will have some support for when, not if, I get stuck. I am a SE major and am just starting
        so I do not know too much about programming or other such things, but I am really enjoying learning more about these things.</p>
        <p>have been married for 6 or so years now and we have a young two-year-old who loves to scream and bite and knows how to open locked doors. 
        So, my life is very exciting and painful. Another thing about me is I am terrible at Ice-breakers... The end.</p>
