            <p>3.	Flexibility and Accessibility: Unlike traditional TTRPG campaigns that require a consistent group of players and a fixed schedule, West Marches games offer unparalleled flexibility. With a larger player pool and asynchronous scheduling, participants can easily find sessions that fit their availability, making it ideal for busy schedules and players from different time zones. This accessibility opens up the hobby to a wider audience, welcoming newcomers and seasoned veterans alike to embark on epic adventures together.</p>
