            <p>2.	Community Collaboration: One of the greatest strengths of the West Marches format is its ability to foster a strong sense of community among players. Collaborative storytelling and shared experiences create a vibrant gaming environment where players can form alliances, rivalries, and lasting friendships both in and out of character. With a diverse cast of characters and players, each session becomes an opportunity for rich role-playing interactions and memorable moments.</p>

            <p>3.	Flexibility and Accessibility: Unlike traditional TTRPG campaigns that require a consistent group of players and a fixed schedule, West Marches games offer unparalleled flexibility. With a larger player pool and asynchronous scheduling, participants can easily find sessions that fit their availability, making it ideal for busy schedules and players from different time zones. This accessibility opens up the hobby to a wider audience, welcoming newcomers and seasoned veterans alike to embark on epic adventures together.</p>
